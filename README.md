# CurrencyGuard: CNN-Based Counterfeit Detection for Indian Notes

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect counterfeit Indian currency. The model is trained on a balanced dataset containing real and fake currency images and is designed to assist in identifying counterfeit notes with high accuracy. The project also features a user-friendly GUI for real-time detection using image uploads or live camera input.

Features:
- CNN-based currency classification: Detects real and fake Indian currency notes.
- Balanced dataset: 1200 training images (600 real, 600 fake), 200 validation images (100 real, 100 fake), and 192 test images.
- Data augmentation: Enhances model generalization.
- Performance metrics: Tracks training and validation accuracy/loss over 150 epochs.
- Graphical User Interface (GUI): Allows users to upload images or capture real-time images for currency detection.

Datasets:
The dataset consists of images of Indian currency notes categorized into:
- Training set
- Validation set
- Test set

Technologies Used:
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow & Keras
- OpenCV
- Tkinter (for GUI)
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- OpenCV
