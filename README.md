# detection_of_counterfeit_indian_currency_using_cnn
This project implements a currency detection system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The CNN using Python programming language is trained to distinguish between real and counterfeit Indian currency notes. The backend [code.ipynb] , developed in Python using TensorFlow and Keras, includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. The trained model is integrated into a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter [detect.py].
